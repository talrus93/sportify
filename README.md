# Sportify
Sportify is a mobile application that allows users to discover and engage with various sports-related activities. Here are the current features of the application:

- **Sport Selection**: Users can choose their favorite sports and mark them as favorites.

- **Location Selection**: Users can select a country, city, and region to customize their sports experience.

I have already developed the following pages:
